{"name":"TSVFilterer","tagline":"Windows tool to filter TSV files visually","body":"### TSVFilterer.\r\nThe problem I am trying to solve here is to filter TSV files on Windows.\r\n\r\nFirst, about TSV files: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values)\r\n\r\nNext, about filtering. The data in TSV files can be filtered in two ways in order to remove unnecessary data for whatever analysis we are doing:\r\n\r\n1. Certain columns can be removed from the file\r\n2. Certain rows can be removed from the file\r\n\r\nI assume that every column contains data of the same type and every row contains data of different types.\r\n\r\nSo, columns are filtered by column number, while rows are filtered by their content.\r\n\r\nFinally, why this tool when there is grep and its infinite filtering capabilities? Because this tool is visual, simple to use, and requires no memorization of commands. Think of it as a dumbed-down version of grep for solving a specific problem.\r\nSimilarly, why this tool when Excel offers good filtering capabilities? Because this tool can handle file sizes that Excel can't.\r\n\r\nLike all other software, this is a work in progress.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
